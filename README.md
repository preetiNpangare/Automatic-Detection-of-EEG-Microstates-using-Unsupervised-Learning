  EEG signal is generally used to detect problems
in the electrical activity of the brain that can be used to
analyze certain brain disorders. EEG topography represents
the dynamical view of how spatial distribution of the electric
potential on the scalp changes over time. Different distributions
of neuron generations in the brain gives rise to the different
configurations of potential maps on the scalp. EEG data is a
multi-channel data which makes itâ€™s analysis complex. This data
can be compressed by finding the microstates and by substituting
the topographies in the original EEG data by the microstate
labels. This provides the compressed and simplified view of the
data. In this project, we are extracting microstates from the EEG
signal by using different unsupervised clustering algorithms and
analyze their performance to obtain the efficient method for
microstate detection.
